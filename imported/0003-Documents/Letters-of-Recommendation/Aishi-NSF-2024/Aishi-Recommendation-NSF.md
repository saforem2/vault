Dear Selection Committee,

I am writing this letter of recommendation for Aishi, who I had the pleasure of supervising this
past summer.

She is one of the most remarkable students I have ever had the privilege to work with and is an
ideal candidate for this opportunity.

Given Aishi's outstanding academic performance thus far, she has a strong background in Computer
Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. She has consistently demonstrated exceptional analytical,
quantitative, and computational skills, consistently achieving top grades in all related coursework.

Aishi possesses unwavering enthusiasm for research, and she is highly motivated. She has
participated in several research projects during her academic journey and has acquired in-depth
knowledge which makes her an excellent fit for this position.

Apart from technical expertise, Aishi possesses excellent teamwork ability, communication, and
presentation skills. In the time that I've known her, she has been an exceptional team player and
displayed wonderful leadership qualities. 

I would also like to highlight Aishi's exceptional performance during the Intro to HPC bootcamp, for
which I served as her mentor over the summer. During the program, she worked hard to learn new
concepts and technologies related to High-Performance Computing and successfully applied them to
produce a high-quality final project.

Aishi is quick to grasp new material and consistently demonstrated an outstanding work ethic and
dedication to her studies. Her commitment to producing an excellent project, combined with the
ability to work effectively in a team, was commendable. 

As a result, I am happy to support her application and would like to strongly recommend her for this
opportunity.  
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information.

Sincerely,
