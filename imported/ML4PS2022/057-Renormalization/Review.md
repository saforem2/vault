In this work, the authors attempt to provide analytical tools for better understanding the properties and behavior of neural networks by exploring the neural network-quantum field theory correspondence (NN-QFT).

In particular, they demonstrate that, for a statistical ensemble of neural networks (NNs), the standard deviation of the weight distribution is a renormalization group flow parameter.

This claim is then verified numerically by comparing against their analytical expression of the effective coupling constant.





by comparing their analytical expression for the effective coupling constant to 



In this work, the authors build on the neural network-quantum field theory correspondence to demonstrate that, for a statistical ensemble of neural networks (NNs), the standard deviation of the weight distribution is a renormalization group flow parameter.



This work begins by considering an effective field theory that is able to reproduce the full expectation value corresponding to an ensemble of NNs.


Building on the neural network-quantum field theory (NN-QFT) correspondence, the authors demonstrate that the standard deviation of the weight distribution is a renormalization group flow parameter.
