# Source Identification and Field Reconstruction of Advection-Diffusion Process from Sparse Sensor Measurements

In this work the authors propose a novel multi-task learning framework for identifying and locating pollution sources by reconstructing the pollutants' concentration from time-series data taken by an array of sensors.

In my opinion, the authors have presented a well thought-out approach to tackling a challenging problem that has the potential to impact many areas of science and engineering (e.g. methane emissions, oceanic currents, seismic waves)

The general approach (and particularly, the diffusion kernel employed in the network architecture) is clearly physically-motivated and performs well on the task of identifying the source.

In particular, the authors point out that:

> Note that, through the advection-diffusion equation, the concentration field is strongly coupled with the source characteristics given $\mathbf{u}$
