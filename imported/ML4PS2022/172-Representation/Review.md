> Main point: **Enforcing passive symmetries in ML Models will improve generalization**

In this work, the authors argue that enforcing passive symmetries in ML models will improve generalization.

They go on to examine different physical systems from this perspective, and argue for their importance in determining the structure of the equations governing them.


By explicitly incorporating these symmetries 

for the importance of these symmetries in determining their

gain insights into the structure of the laws governing them.


They go on to use this perspective to make arguments about 
They go on to provide examples of physical systems that have

Additionally, they note that
