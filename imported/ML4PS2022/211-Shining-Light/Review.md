# Shining Light on Data

> [!note]+
> We show how fine-scale features of the geometric structure arising from natural laws, conservation principles, and dynamical structure can be extracted from _discrete_ approximations to quantum mechanical processes given by data-driven graph Laplacians and localized wavepackets

In this work, the authors propose a framework for understanding the structure of large datasets. Explicitly, they argue, that the underlying structure of a given dataset can be interrogated by simulating the quantum dynamics of a propagating signal.

The authors go on to claim that this data-driven quantum dynamics formulation establishes the first general convergence result for geodesics and geodesic polar coordinates (GPC) from data.

By applying this approach to the Social Distancing Metric dataset, they show that their method is able to meaningfully separate geographic regions by their social mobility and is also able to successfully identify outlying patterns.

Overall, this paper suggests a unique approach to identifying structure directly from data, and should be generally applicable to arbitrary datasets.
