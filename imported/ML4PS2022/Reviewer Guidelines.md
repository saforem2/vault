Thank you for agreeing to serve as a reviewer at the Machine Learning and Physical Sciences NeurIPS 2022 workshop! This document outlines the expectations for you as a reviewer as well as guidelines for crafting meaningful reviews. Please contact [ml4ps2022@googlegroups.com](mailto:ml4ps2022@googlegroups.com) with any questions.

## Role of the reviewer 

You will be expected to review extended abstracts (4-page short papers) by the review deadline of October 14, 2022, 23:59 [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe). For each of your assigned papers you will be asked to provide a numerical score between -2 and 2 (described below), a review evaluating the paper, and your confidence in the review.  All submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 readers. 

This is a double-blind review process. As such, authors were asked to make reasonable efforts to hide their identities and similarly reviewers should make all efforts to keep their identity hidden from the authors. ArXiv papers are not considered prior work as they have not been peer-reviewed; as such you should review your assigned papers as if arXiv did not exist. It is important to treat papers fairly whether or not you know (or suspect) who wrote them. 

## What to look for

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from machine learning and the physical sciences to demonstrate their progress and exchange ideas. As such, submissions of completed projects as well as high-quality works in progress are welcome.

Considering appendices and supplementary material is optional, and reviewers can base their review only on the main 4 pages of the paper. Although authors are asked to consider a paper checklist at the end of their paper, given the more restricted scope and length of the workshop submissions this checklist should not enter as a basis of evaluation. For the same reason, we ask reviewers to be mindful of evaluating the workshop papers distinctly from how they would assess a journal paper or full-length conference submission.

All accepted papers should be technically sound and make a contribution to their relevant fields. This contribution can be either in theory or in practice (or both). We are interested in papers that contribute novel methods and techniques, but we are equally interested in applications of existing machine learning techniques to real-world problems in physical sciences. If the paper subject does not match your core scientific/ML expertise you are invited to provide your review based on the appropriateness of the paper for the workshop and clarity of the presented material; you will be able to indicate this in the review form. 

Please keep the following criteria in mind:

- **Is the paper appropriate for the workshop? I.e., does it describe research relating to the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences? (please note, this can be both in the direction of using ML in physical science applications or studying physically-motivated ML).**

- **Does the paper describe work that is novel and/or interesting? Does it show promise to improve research, methods, or results in its intended area?**

- **Does the paper adequately describe what will be presented?**

Minor flaws can be corrected before the camera ready deadline and should not be the sole reason to recommend rejecting a paper. 

## Writing reviews

Please keep in mind that your review is important for both making workshop acceptance decisions and for providing feedback to the authors. Consequently, extremely short reviews are unhelpful and we ask that you take the time to write a thoughtful and detailed review. Please reach out if you are not able to do so for all your assigned papers. Additionally, please be specific in your suggestions for improvements and formal in your response (i.e., using the phrases ‘authors’ and ‘paper’ rather than ‘you’).

When assigning number grades, please use the following guidelines:

- 2: Strong Accept — An excellent paper that should be considered for an oral presentation.

- 1: Accept — A good paper that clearly belongs at the workshop.

- 0: Borderline — A paper that you are unsure about, but that you do not feel would be out of place at the workshop.

- -1: Weak Reject — A paper that doesn’t have any technical issues, but you are unsure meets the bar for the workshop.

- -2: Reject — A paper that has technical issues, is clearly below the bar, or is not appropriate for the venue (i.e., is not related to machine learning)

You will also have the opportunity to select your qualitative degree of confidence in your review (low, medium, or high) as well as whether the paper was evaluated based on its core scientific content or programmatic considerations (e.g., appropriateness for the workshop and clarity of presentation). This will aid in contextualizing your review.

## Entering reviews

Paper reviews are handled through the [CMT website](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4PS2022/Submission/Rvw). If you have agreed to review for this workshop, you will be able to login to this website and select the “reviewer” role from the drop-down list on the top banner, in order to see the papers assigned to you as a reviewer. Please view the paper by clicking on the paper ID and enter your review using the interface, when ready.

Please note, we have made reasonable efforts during the review assignment to avoid obvious conflicts of interest. If you nonetheless recognize a conflict of interest with one of your assigned papers, please notify us.

## Ethics for reviewing papers

1. Protect ideas: You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the ideas in the papers you review. You may not show your assigned papers to anyone else unless they are helping with the review and you should destroy any copies of the papers and reviews when the process is completed.

2. Avoid conflicts of interest: While we make an effort to incorporate domain conflicts in the assignment of papers to reviewers, it is still possible to be assigned a paper with which you have a conflict of interest. If this happens, please let us know and DO NOT submit a review. Conflicts of interest include (but are not limited to): working at the same institution, being directly involved in the work, collaborating with the authors on other work within the past 3 years, and being presently or previously advisor to/advised by the author. 

3. Be professional: Please be constructive in your reviews, particularly if criticizing any of the work. Negative reviews should aim to help the authors understand the shortcomings of their work and how they might improve. Sarcastic, cruel, or otherwise belittling comments are not to be included in reviews. Please make every effort to write a kind and helpful review that you would be happy having your name on (were it not anonymous).**
