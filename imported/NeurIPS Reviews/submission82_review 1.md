#### Critical parametric quantum sensing with machine learning
- **Decision**: 1 (Accept)

- **Is the paper appropriate for the workshop?** i.e., does it describe research relating to the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences? (please note, this can be both in the direction of using ML in physical science applications or studying physically motivated ML)
	- Yes, the paper looks at using a machine learning to enable a fast and reliable measurement protocol in critical open quantum systems.
- **Does the paper describe work that is novel and/or interesting?**
	- Yes, the paper describes a method for improving upon existing measurement protocols quickly obtain high precision measurements in critical open quantum systems.
	- This is done by using a time series classification model to extract information from the critical dynamics of the Kerr resonator.
	- The ability to perform measurements quickly helps to prevent errors caused by quantum fluctuations induced by the qubit-resonator.
- **Does the paper adequately describe what will be presented?**
	- The authors do a good job of motivating the need for the presented approach and demonstrate its usefuleness within current experimental parameter ranges.
