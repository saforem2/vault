# Letter of Support for Ankur Singha

To Whom it May Concern,

My name is [Sam Foreman](https://samforeman.me), and I am writing to express my support for Ankur Singha's consideration for the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/).

I am currently an assistant computational scientist in the [Data Science group](https://alcf.anl.gov/about/people/group/506) at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), where I work broadly at the intersection of scientific machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC). Prior to this I received my PhD in theoretical Physics from the University of Iowa (2019), with a focus on using ML to build more efficient sampling algorithms for lattice field theories. 

My initial exposure to HPC came at the end of graduate school when I was selected to receive the Office of Science Graduate Research (SCGSR) Fellowship. Through this program, I was able to spend my final year working at Argonne National Laboratory where I focused on scaling up my code to run efficiently on their supercomputing resources. This opportunity proved to be a pivotal moment in my career, and ultimately paved the way for my current appointment at ALCF.

Ankur has recently completed his PhD on _Machine Learning Methods for the Simulation of Lattice Field Theories_ at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. He has a well-established record of impactful research[^1][^2][^3][^4] and has made great progress towards improving simulations for computationally challenging problems in high energy physics.

As part of his PhD thesis, Ankur worked to develop novel techniques that have shown significant speedup in generating gauge configurations for a (relatively) simple two-dimensional system. For the proposed research, Ankur will work on testing and scaling these methods to more complicated physical theories in higher dimensions. 

Ultimately, we are interested in making predictions for quantities which can be experimentally measured. In order to do so, we first generate gauge field configurations at increasing spatial resolution, and then perform an extrapolation to the continuum (infinite resolution) limit. By repeating this procedure over many such configurations, we are able to generate statistics and uncertainty estimates on our predictions.

Currently, this sample generation component is a major bottleneck in the (much larger) lattice QCD workflow, and is a major source of uncertainty in our current models. Because of this, developing more efficient techniques is a very active area of research that is of great importance to both the nuclear and high energy communities. In particular, these calculations will be critical for upcoming experiments[^g2], and will play a key role in future high-precision tests of the standard model.

As a postdoctoral fellow at ALCF, Ankur will be able to work in close collaboration with both our local Lattice QCD group[^alcf-lqcd], as well as our many ongoing external collaborations with other members of the [U.S. Lattice QCD Group](https://www.usqcd.org/). In addition, he will also have the opportunity to work and collaborate with our Data Science team and can participate in our many training activities, workshops, lecture series, etc. In doing so, he will be surrounded by a team of active, interdisciplinary researchers working on challenging problems across virtually all scientific domains.

In conclusion, I believe that this fellowship presents an excellent opportunity for Ankur to continue a very promising research direction at a world-class institution, and will provide him with both the skills and resources needed to get it done. Because of this, I would like to express my **strong support** for Ankur's consideration for the Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, and I look forward to getting to work with him.

Sincerely,
Sam Foreman
