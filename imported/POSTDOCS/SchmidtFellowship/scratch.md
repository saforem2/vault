~~current techniques are known to have a computational cost which scales exponentially with increasing resolution, severely limiting (in practice) our ability to ~~

~~calculate statistics over these "representative" configurations.~~
~~As a scientific user facility, the ALCF provides computational resources and support to researchers all over the world and across virtually all scientific domains. ~~

~~these generated configurations are used to generate estimates of physical observables by performing an extrapolation to the continuum limit and taking an average over the samples.~~

~~**With multiple HEP / Nuclear experiments expected to be conducted over next ~years this will require lattice calculations with increasing precision against which to compare. By training generative models to more efficiently generate sample configurations we are able to more accurately predict expectation values of physical observables.**~~
~~US LQCD collaboration has a long history of pushing the boundaries of HPC, and consistently has major allocations across virtually all of the major DOE supercomputing centers.~~

~~a problem of central importance to both the high energy and nuclear physics communities and is a very active area of research.

~~In addition, these calculations will be particularly important for upcoming experiments[^g2], and will play an important role in further high-precision tests of the standard model. ~~

~~and are of central importance to both the high energy and nuclear physics communities.~~

~~, this is a major bottleneck that is (currently) in the larger HEP analysis workflow, and as a result, is a problem of great interest to both the high energy and nuclear physics communities.~~

~~During his graduate studies he worked to design and implement novel generative modeling techniques for lattice gauge theories, and his thorough experience with modern ML frameworks puts him in an excellent position to carry out the proposed research at ALCF. ~~

~~Since this is currently a major bottleneck in the larger analysis workflow, this is a problem of great interest to both the high energy and nuclear physics communities.~

~~Because of this, developing new techniques to more efficiently generate sample configurations is a problem of great interest to both the high energy and physics communities.~~

~~Because of this, _more_ configurations we are able to systematically reduce the uncertainty when estimating quantities of interest.~~


~~All in all, I believe that this fellowship presents an excellent opportunity to continue a promising research direction at a world-class institution where he will have access to unparalleled computational resources and an amazing team of active, interdisciplinary computational scientists and engineers.~~

~~For my final year of grad school, I was selected to receive the Office of Science Graduate Research (SCGSR) Fellowship, which allowed me to spend my final year at Argonne National Laboratory working on the proposed research project. This opportunity proved to be a pivotal moment in my career, and ultimately paved the way for my current appointment at ALCF.

~~Through this experience I learned a great deal about running large-scale scientific workflows, and was ultimately the opportunity that paved the way to my current appointment at ALCF.~~

~~I am pleased to nominate Ankur Singha for the Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship.  ~~
