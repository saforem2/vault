# Automated Benchmarking and Performance Analysis on HPC Systems

Computational methods are becoming an increasingly important aspect of research across virtually all scientific domains.

As researchers continue to develop and test new ideas, it is important that they are able to utilize the resources available to them effectively.

Unfortunately, this often requires significant time and effort spent on writing, building, testing, and evaluating complicated libraries and codebases,
on different systems and at different scales.

The goal of this project is to build a set of tools to help automate this process.

In particular, we aim to develop a set of tools for researchers that helps them to maintain productivity by abstracting away the complexities associated with running code on large scale distributed systems.
