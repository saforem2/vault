# Julia for HPC

Julia is a high-level dynamic language that was designed from the beginning for high performance.[^1]

It has seen continued growth and adoption in recent years, and is being increasingly adopted by new projects, which will require support on current and future HPC systems.

The goal of this project is to:
- Better understand how Julia performs at scale on HPC systems
- Identify and understand possible limitations / advantages / disadvantages for different use cases
- Understand and develop tools to support and utilize Julia effectively on HPC systems

---

This will require:
- a detailed understanding of how Julia performs on both current and future HPC systems
- what current and predicted limitations are
- and how to utilize Julia effectively on HPC systems

Its rise in recent years has been driven in large part by a scientifically driven community, due
It has seen continued development in recent years and
