### Ice Sheet Modeling
- **Field or research area**: Scientific computing, climate
- **Abstract**: The response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to the changing climate remains the single greatest uncertainty in projections in sea level rise. The BISICLES ice sheet model, developed at LBL, is an adaptive mesh refinement model designed to efficiently and accurately understand and project ice sheet dynamics.
