- Murali ran deepcam across 10 nodes on scale-debug
- Can't run to convergence due to node-local storage issues
- Murali tested with `set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh`, seems to work OK
- Running deepcam on bare metal build

## `oc20`
- While waiting for node-local storage (by MONDAY):
  - Write scaling script to run on different numbers of GPUs
  - Share logs with team at Nvidia to see if they notice anything
