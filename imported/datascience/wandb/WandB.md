# Weights & Biases

- Would be useful for model versioning and experiment tracking
    - Having a central "hub" of models to dynamically pull from 
    - Useful to store pre-trained models that can be modified / adapted / fine-tuned as needed
   

## Hydra
- [Configuring W&B Projects with Hydra](https://wandb.ai/adrishd/hydra-example/reports/Configuring-W-B-Projects-with-Hydra--VmlldzoxNTA2MzQw)
    - Read the official documentation for using W&B and Hydra together [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/hydra)
    - The accompanying codebase can be found [here](http://wandb.me/hydra-report-codebase)
    - First though, letâ€™s cover both solutions in a little more detail before we dive deeper.
    - For a minimal implementation checkout this [official example](http://wandb.me/hydra-minimal-example)
