# Milestones and Tasks by Year and Quarter
## 2022 Q1
### HMC-ML ( [`l2hmc-qcd`](https://github.com/saforem2/l2hmc-qcd))
- Finished:
    - Implementation of hyperparameter optimization workflow 
    - Setting up integrations for automated experiment tracking and model versioning
    - Implementing and testing simplified update method that combines forward / backward updates
- Ongoing tests to better understand:
    - Tradeoff between training cost and model performance
    - How network size and architecture impact model performance
    - How both cost and performance scale with lattice volume
        - Identified and resolved issue related to training instability on larger lattice volumes
- Finalized plans for student Summer Research Aide position on **Hyper-parameter Optimization and Scaling Studies for ML Models in Lattice Field Theory**
- Invited talk on [Machine Learning & HEP](https://saforem2.github.io/physicsSeminar/#/) at UNC Greensboro
- Submitted white paper on [Applications of Machine Learning to Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05838) for SnowMass 2021
