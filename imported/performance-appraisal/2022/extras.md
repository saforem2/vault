### Reflection
- One of my biggest strengths is being confident in my abilities when confronted with new challenges.
- Strong analytic background --> deconstruct problems into a set of manageable tasks / identify potential issues which may arise.
- I always enjoy learning new things, and, as with most people, I've found that I learn the most when I am forced outside of my "comfort zone"
	- Because of this, I've learned **a lot** from through the many collaborations / interactions I've had with different users and teams at the ALCF
	- I've enjoyed working with users and trying to come up with creative solutions to novel problems at the forefront of High Performance Computing and Machine Learning
- I'm capable of turning ideas into manageable plans and executing themwith confidence
	- I enjoy wrestling with new ideas and approaching complicated problems in a systematic and well though-out manner
- Working at the intersection of math, physics, machine learning, and high performance computing has forced me to adapt quickly while effectively taking in new information, allowing myself to remain oriented in an area whose direction is ever-changing.
  - While at times this rapid development cycle and constant evolution can be challenging, I've found that successfully navigating difficult problems is incredibly rewarding and provides a sense of fulfillment.
- I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and tend to actively seek out opportunities that are impactful with the potential to create change.
