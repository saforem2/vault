# ATPESC 2022

- From Venkat:
  > In addition to topics covered in 2021, good to consider HPO and AI testbeds
  > Good to consider including postdocs such as Nathan Nichols, Zhen Xie, Denis Boyda, Riccardo Balin to help with the content, organization, etc.  
  
We should target Polaris for this. Also, the hardware track will cover various systems from the AI testbed. So, we can consider exposing the attendees to run on the testbed.
