**Session 6: Parallel Training Methods for AI -** March 12, 2023 3:00 pm - 4:30 pm CT

- **Blurb**: We present modern parallelism techniques and discuss how they can be used to train and distribute large models across many GPUs.

- **Presenter**: Sam Foreman: [https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/sam-foreman](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/sam-foreman)

- **Sam Foreman** is a Computational Scientist with a background in high energy physics, currently working as a postdoc in the ALCF. He is generally interested in the application of machine learning to computational problems in physics, particularly within the context of high-performance computing. Sam's current research focuses on using deep generative modeling to help build better sampling algorithms for simulations in lattice gauge theory.
